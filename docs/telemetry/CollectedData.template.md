This is the default for projects using the ignite-metrics library. Each project's own `./docs/telemetry/CollectedData.md` file should contain very specific information under each of the following sections:

* 'What metrics data DO we collect'

-->
## What metrics data DON'T we collect

We do not collect any of the below listed items in our metric data:

1. User identifiable data (names, email addresses, aliases, handles, etc.)
2. CIDs
3. IP addresses

Countly also calls out how they protect your data at https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/360037501372-Security-Privacy-and-Access-FAQ

## What metrics data DO we collect

As a general rule, we collect only application data; no user data. Some examples of application data we collect are:

| Metric data name | Metric feature name | What is this data used for |
|:----------------:|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Fill in          | Fill in             | Fill in                    |
|                  |                     |                            |
|                  |                     |                            |
